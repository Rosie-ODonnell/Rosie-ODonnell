### Hey, I'm Rosie ✌🏼 

I'm a self-taught software developer, currently working with HTML, CSS and Javascript. 👩🏼‍💻

I'm currently part of the [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) Spring 2021 Cohort.

I'm currently working on some Javascript games... stay tuned for those!

I'm passionate about making the tech industry more accessible and about using the power of technology for good.
