### Hey, I'm Rosie ✌🏼 

I'm a self-taught software developer 👩🏼‍💻, currently working with HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
<br /> <br />
I'm part of the [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) Spring 2021 Cohort.

At the moment, I'm working on some games using HTML, CSS and Javascript... check them out in in my [Games repo]().

I'm passionate about making the tech industry more accessible and about using the power of technology for good.
